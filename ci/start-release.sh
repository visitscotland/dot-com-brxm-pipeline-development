#üîπ Script's points of focus
#‚úî Bug-Free Boolean Handling ‚Üí hasStashedChanges=0 ensures stash is applied only when needed.
#‚úî Only runs git stash if local changes exist (git diff --quiet)
#‚úî More Efficient Change Detection ‚Üí Uses git diff --quiet 2>/dev/null instead of git stash blindly.
#‚úî Safe Stash Handling ‚Üí Prevents unnecessary output spam and ensures stash drop works only after a successful apply.
#‚úî Uses git pull --ff-only to prevent unnecessary merge commits that git pull origin could perform.
#‚úî Fails Fast on Errors ‚Üí Uses set -e and structured error handling.
#‚úî User-Friendly Output ‚Üí Uses clear emojis for better readability in CI logs.
#‚úî Correct Branch Restoration ‚Üí Ensures smooth rollback if the branch still exists.
#‚úî Measures and logs total execution time ‚è≥.
